# WDI_Project_one
Lee Cash's first project at the end of module one of WDI-23

I borrowed some images from this website. https://github.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets.

I created an object called 'deckOfCards' where I stored the values required to display aspects of the gameplay to the user interface.

I created an initial function called 'dealCards' which would pick 9 unique cards from the 'deckOfCards' that could be used for each hand.

I then started work on the logic to determine where the user or the computer had the best hand.
